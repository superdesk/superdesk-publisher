# Superdesk Publisher


## Overview
This is a plugin for [superdesk](https://github.com/superdesk/superdesk).
The Superdesk Publisher is an API-centric delivery tool for all digital platforms. Written from scratch in 2016, it utilizes the knowledge gained from 17 years of delivering digital news at scale with Newscoop. The Publisher is designed to work with any editorial system. Naturally, it works the best with our in-house newsroom management system, Superdesk. Therefore, it allows independent maintenance, upgrade and change of the editorial back-end system.

## Configure Superdesk
In order for Superdesk to expose the Publisher module, you must configure it in client config files.

### Client
Add the dependency to your instance of superdesk.
In `superdesk/client/package.json` add `superdesk-publisher` to the dependencies
(replacing `#a79d428` with the specific commit you require):
```js
"dependencies": {
    ....,
    "superdesk-publisher": "superdesk/superdesk-publisher#a79d428"
}
```

After that, run npm install to install additional dependencie.

Don't forget to add publisher to your superdesk config in `superdesk/client/superdesk.config.js`, and
to enable the publisher feature:
```js
apps: [
    ....,
    'superdesk-publisher'
],
publisher: {
    protocol: 'http',                /* http or https */
    tenant: 'tenant-1',              /* tenant - semantically subdomain, '' is allowed */
    domain: 'website.com',           /* domainname for the publisher */
    base: 'api/v1',                  /* api base path */

    wsProtocol: 'wss',                /* ws or wss (websocket), '' or  unspecified defaults to 'wss' */
    wsDomain: 'WebSocketDomain.com',  /* domain name (usually domain as above) */
    wsPath: '/ws',                    /* path to websocket root dir */
    wsPort: '8080'                    /* default 443 */
},
```

publisher.tenant - publisher tenant name
publisher.domain - publisher domain
publisher.base - publisher base url

publisher.wsDomain - publisher websocket domain address
publisher.wsPort - publisher websocket path
publisher.wsPort - publisher websocket port

This will import the `superdesk-publisher` node module and load the `superdesk.publisher` angular module in the main angular application.
